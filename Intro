types of API -> 
FastAPI : Asynchronous faster
Flask : Synchronus slower

fast API ->
1. uses 'swagger ui and Redoc' to automatically generate interactive APi documentation
2. uses 'type hints' to help with automatic validation

| Feature                   | Flask                               | FastAPI                                      |
